1. Write a script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. Create a program that asks the user for a number 'n' and then prints the squares of all numbers from 1 to 'n'.

3. Write a program that accepts an integer input from the user, and prints "Odd" or "Even" depending on the input.

4. Make a program that takes a list (e.g., [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]) and prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

5. Write a script where the user enters a string, and the program calculates and prints the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

6. Create a function that accepts a word from the user and reverses it. For instance, if the user inputs "python", it should return "nohtyp".

7. Write a program that computes the factorial of an integer 'n' provided by the user (for example, if n=4, then the program would compute 432*1).

8. Create a script that generates a list containing the Fibonacci sequence, up until the nth term.

9. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (e.g., "13" would return [1, 13], "12" would return [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]).

10. Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game.
